<h2 id="introduction-overview" class="impressum__text">Introduction and Overview</h2>.
<p class="impressum__text">We have written this Privacy Policy (version 12/19/2022-322365556) to serve you in accordance with the requirements of the <a class="impressum__text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=322365556#d1e2269-1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> and applicable national laws, to explain which personal data (data for short) we as data controllers &#8211; and the order processors (e.g. Provider) &#8211; process, will process in the future and what lawful options you have. The terms used are to be understood gender-neutral.<br />
<strong class="impressum__text">In short:</strong> We inform you comprehensively about data that we process about you.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Data privacy statements usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. This privacy statement, on the other hand, is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. As far as it is conducive to transparency, technical <strong class="impressum__text">terms are explained in a reader-friendly way</strong>, links to further information are provided and <strong class="impressum__text">graphics</strong> are used. In this way, we provide information in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the course of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not possible by providing the most concise, unclear and legalistic explanations possible, as is often standard practice on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative and perhaps there is one or the other piece of information that you did not know yet.<br />
If questions nevertheless remain, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible office named below or in the imprint, to follow the existing links and to look at further information on third party sites. Our contact details can of course also be found in the imprint.</p>.
<h2 id="scope" class="impressum__text">Scope</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">This data protection declaration applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (order processors). By personal data, we mean information within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 DSGVO, such as a person's name, e-mail address and postal address. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and invoice our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:</p>
<ul class="impressum__text">
<li class="impressum__text">all online presences (websites, online stores) that we operate</li>.
<li class="impressum__text">Social media appearances and email communications</li>.
<li class="impressum__text">mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>.
</ul>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">In short:</strong> The privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in the company via the aforementioned channels in a structured manner. If we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately, if necessary.</p>.
<h2 id="legalbases" class="impressum__text">Legalbases</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">In the following privacy statement, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.<br />
As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016. You can, of course, read this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law, at <a class="impressum__text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
<ol>
<li class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">consent</strong> (Article 6(1) lit. a DSGVO): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of your entered data of a contact form.</li>.
<li class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">contract</strong> (Article 6(1) lit. b DSGVO): In order to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data. For example, if we conclude a purchase contract with you, we need personal information in advance.</li>
<li class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Legal obligation</strong> (Article 6(1) lit. c DSGVO): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are required by law to keep invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain personal data.</li>
<li class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Rightful interests</strong> (Article 6(1) lit. f DSGVO): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we need to process certain data in order to operate our website in a secure and economically efficient manner. This processing is therefore a legitimate interest.</li>
</ol>
<p class="impressum__text">Further conditions such as the perception of recordings in the public interest and exercise of public authority and the protection of vital interests do not occur with us as a rule. Insofar as such a legal basis should be relevant, this is shown at the appropriate place.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
<ul class="impressum__text">
<li class="impressum__text">In <strong class="impressum__text">Austria</strong>, this is the Federal Act on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (<strong class="impressum__text">Data Protection Act</strong>), in short <strong class="impressum__text">DSG</strong>.</li>
<li class="impressum__text">In <strong class="impressum__text">Germany</strong>, the <strong class="impressum__text">Federal Data Protection Act</strong>, in short<strong class="impressum__text">BDSG</strong>, applies.
</ul>
<p class="impressum__text">If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p>
<h2 id="contact-data-responsible" class="impressum__text">contact-data of the responsible</h2>.

<h2 id="storage duration" class="impressum__text">storage duration</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">That we store personal data only as long as it is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products applies as a general criterion with us. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are required by law to store certain data even after the original purpose has ceased to exist, for example for accounting purposes.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Should you wish your data to be deleted or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as soon as possible and insofar as there is no obligation to store it.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">We will inform you about the specific duration of the respective data processing below, provided we have further information on this.</p>
<h2 id="rights-dsgvo" class="impressum__text">Rights under the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>.
<p class="impressum__text">Pursuant to Articles 13, 14 DSGVO, we inform you about the following rights you have to ensure that there is fair and transparent processing of data:</p>
<ul class="impressum__text">
<li class="impressum__text">According to Article 15 of the GDPR, you have a right of access to whether we process data about you. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and to know the following information:
<ul class="impressum__text">
<li class="impressum__text">for what purpose we perform the processing;</li>
<li class="impressum__text">the categories, that is, the types of data that are processed;</li>
<li class="impressum__text">who receives this data and, if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be guaranteed;</li>
<li class="impressum__text">how long the data will be stored;</li>
<li class="impressum__text">the existence of the right to rectify, erase or restrict processing and the right to object to processing;</li>
<li class="impressum__text">that you can complain to a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below);</li>
<li class="impressum__text">the origin of the data if we did not collect it from you;</li>
<li class="impressum__text">whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically evaluated in order to arrive at a personal profile of you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="impressum__text">According to Article 16 of the GDPR, you have a right to rectify data, which means that we must correct data if you find errors.</li>
<li class="impressum__text">According to Article 17 of the GDPR, you have the right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"), which specifically means that you may request the deletion of your data.</li>
<li class="impressum__text">According to Article 18 of the GDPR, you have the right to restrict processing, which means that we may only store the data but not use it any further.</li>
<li class="impressum__text">According to Article 20 of the GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that we will provide you with your data in a commonly used format upon request.</li>.
<li class="impressum__text">According to Article 21 of the GDPR, you have a right to object, which, once enforced, entails a change in processing.
<ul class="impressum__text">
<li class="impressum__text">If the processing of your data is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you may object to the processing. We will then check as soon as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection.</li>
<li class="impressum__text">If data is used to conduct direct marketing, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may not use your data thereafter for direct marketing.</li>
<li class="impressum__text">If data is used to perform profiling, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may not use your data for profiling thereafter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Under Article 22 of the GDPR, you may have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (for example, profiling).</li>
<li class="impressum__text">According to Article 77 of the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint. This means that you can complain to the data protection authority at any time if you believe that the data processing of personal data violates the GDPR.</li>
</ul>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">In short:</strong> You have rights &#8211; do not hesitate to contact the responsible party listed above with us!</p>
<p class="impressum__text">If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or that your data protection rights have been violated in any other way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. For Austria, this is the data protection authority, whose website can be found at <a class="impressum__text" href="https://www.dsb.gv.at/?tid=322365556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a>. In Germany, there is a data protection officer for each federal state. For more information, you can contact the <a class="impressum__text" href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI)</a>. The following local data protection authority is responsible for our company:</p>
<h2 id="baden-wuerttemberg-datenschutzbehoerde" class="impressum__text">Baden-Württemberg Data Protection Authority</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">State Commissioner for Data Protection:</strong> Dr. Stefan Brink<br />
<strong class="impressum__text">Address:</strong> Königstraße 10a, 70173 Stuttgart<br />
<strong class="impressum__text">Telefonnr.:</strong> 07 11/61 55 41-0<br />

</p>
<h2 id="datenuebertragung-drittlaender" class="impressum__text">Data transfer to third countries</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">We only transfer or process data to countries outside the EU (third countries) if you consent to this processing, if this is required by law or contractually necessary and in any case only to the extent that this is generally permitted. Your consent is in most cases the most important reason that we have data processed in third countries. Processing personal data in third countries such as the United States, where many software vendors provide services and have their server locations, may mean that personal data is processed and stored in unexpected ways.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">We expressly point out that, in the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA. Data processing by US services (such as Google Analytics) may result in data not being processed and stored anonymously. Furthermore, US government authorities may be able to access individual data. In addition, it may happen that collected data is linked with data from other services of the same provider, if you have a corresponding user account. Where possible, we try to use server locations within the EU, if this is offered.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">We will inform you in more detail about data transfer to third countries, where applicable, at the appropriate places in this privacy policy.</p>
<h2 id="security-data-processing" class="impressum__text">Security of data processing</h2>.
<p class="impressum__text">To protect personal data, we have implemented both technical and organizational measures. Where possible, we encrypt or pseudonymize personal data. In this way, we make it as difficult as possible, within the scope of our possibilities, for third parties to infer personal information from our data.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Art. 25 of the GDPR speaks here of &#8220;data protection through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings&#8221; and thus means that both software (e.g., forms) and hardware (e.g., access to the server room) should always be designed with security in mind and that appropriate measures should be taken. In the following, we will go into more detail on specific measures, if necessary.</p>.
<h2 id="tls-encryption-https" class="impressum__text">TLS encryption with https</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">TLS, encryption and https sound very technical and they are. We use HTTPS (the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure stands for "secure hypertext transfer protocol") to transfer data bug-proof on the Internet.<br />
This means that the complete transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured &#8211; no one can &#8220;eavesdrop&#8221;.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">This means we have introduced an additional layer of security and comply with data protection by design of technology (<a class="impressum__text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=322365556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article 25(1) DSGVO</a>). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data.<br />.
You can recognize the use of this data transfer protection by the small lock symbol <img role="img" src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/schlosssymbol-https.svg" width="17" height="18" /> at the top left of the browser, to the left of the Internet address (e.g. examplepage.com) and the use of the https scheme (instead of http) as part of our Internet address.<br />
If you want to know more on the topic of encryption, we recommend doing a Google search for &#8220;Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki&#8221; to get good links to more in-depth information.</p>

<p class="impressum__text">Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user specific data.<br />
Below we explain what cookies are and why they are used so that you can better understand the following privacy policy.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Whenever you browse the Internet, you use a browser. Popular browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">One thing cannot be denied: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. More precisely, they are HTTP cookies, as there are other cookies for other applications. HTTP cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by our website. These cookie files are automatically placed in the cookie folder, effectively the &#8220;brain&#8221; of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Cookies store certain user data from you, such as language or personal page settings. When you return to our site, your browser transmits the "user-related" information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our site knows who you are and offers you the setting you are used to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file, in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">The following graphic shows a possible interaction between a web browser such as Chrome and the web server. Here, the web browser requests a website and receives a cookie back from the server, which the browser uses again as soon as another page is requested.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">

<p class="impressum__text">There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually, as each cookie stores different data. Also, the expiration time of a cookie varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other "pests". Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.</p>.

<h3 class="impressum__text">What are the types of cookies?</h3>

<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Since 2009, there have been the so-called "Cookie Guidelines". This states that the storage of cookies requires <strong class="impressum__text">consent</strong> (Article 6 (1) lit. a DSGVO) from you. Within the EU countries, however, there are still very different reactions to these directives. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 96 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (TKG). In Germany, the Cookie Directives were not implemented as national law. Instead, the implementation of this directive took place largely in § 15 para.3 of the Telemedia Act (TMG)</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">For absolutely necessary cookies, even in the absence of consent, there are <strong class="impressum__text">legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO), which in most cases are economic in nature. We want to provide visitors to the website with a pleasant user experience and for this purpose certain cookies are often absolutely necessary.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">If cookies are used that are not absolutely necessary, this only happens in the case of your consent. The legal basis in this respect is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">In the following sections you will be informed in more detail about the use of cookies, if used software uses cookies.</p>.

<h3 class="impressum__text">What is customer data?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">In order to be able to offer our service or our contractual services, we also process data of our customers and business partners. Among these data are always personal data. Customer data is all information that is processed on the basis of a contractual or pre-contractual cooperation in order to be able to provide the services offered. Customer data is therefore all collected information that we collect and process about our customers.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we process customer data?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">There are many reasons why we collect and process customer data. The most important is that we simply need various data to provide our services. Sometimes your e-mail address is enough here, but if you purchase a product or service, for example, we also need data such as name, address, bank data or contract data. We also use the data subsequently for marketing and sales optimization, so that we can improve our overall service to our customers. Another important point is our customer service, which is always very important to us. We want you to be able to come to us at any time with questions about our offers, and for this we need at least your e-mail address.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is processed?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Which data exactly are stored, can be reproduced here only by categories. This always depends on what services you receive from us. In some cases, you only give us your e-mail address, so that we can, for example, contact you or we can answer your questions. In other cases, you purchase a product or service from us and for this we need significantly more information, such as your contact details, payment details and contract details.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Here is a list of possible data we receive and process from you:</p>
<ul class="impressum__text">
<li class="impressum__text">Name</li>
<li class="impressum__text">contact address</li>
<li class="impressum__text">E-Mail-Adresse</li>
<li class="impressum__text">telephone number</li>
<li class="impressum__text">date of birth</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Payment data (invoices, bank data, payment history, etc.)</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Contract data ( duration, content)</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Use data (websites visited, access data ect.)</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Metadata (IP address, device information)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="impressum__text">How long will the data be stored?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">As soon as we no longer need the customer data to fulfill our contractual obligations and our purposes, and the data is also no longer necessary for possible warranty and liability obligations, we delete the corresponding customer data. This is the case, for example, when a business contract ends. After that, the statute of limitations is usually 3 years, although longer periods are possible in individual cases. Of course, we also comply with the statutory retention obligations. Your customer data will most certainly not be passed on to third parties unless you have given explicit consent to do so.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Legal bases for the processing of your data are Art. 6 para 1 lit. a DSGVO (consent), Art. 6 para 1 lit. b DSGVO (contract or pre-contractual measures), Art. 6 para 1 lit. f DSGVO (legitimate interests) and in special cases (e.g. medical services) Art. 9 para 2 lit. a. DSGVO (processing of special categories).</p>
<p class="impressum__text">In the case of the protection of vital interests, data processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. c. DSGVO. For the purposes of health care, occupational medicine, medical diagnosis, health or social care or treatment, or for the management of health or social care systems and services, the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with Art. 9 (2) lit. h. DSGVO. If you voluntarily provide data of the special categories, the processing is based on Art. 9 (2) lit. a. DSGVO.</p>

In addition, we store your data as long as and insofar as we are subject to legal obligations to store it. Thereafter, we keep accounting records pertaining to the contract (invoices, contract documents, account statements, etc.) 10 years (§ 147<br />

</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">
<span class="impressum__text" style="font-weight: 400">By carrying out the registration process, you enter into a pre-contractual agreement with us to enter into a contract of use of our platform (although not automatically creates an obligation to pay). S</span>you invest time to enter data and register and we provide you with our services after logging into our system and viewing your customer account. We also fulfill our contractual obligations. Finally, we need to keep registered users informed of important changes by email. Thus, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO (performance of pre-contractual measures, fulfillment of a contract) applies.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">If necessary, also obtain your consent, for example, if you voluntarily provide more than the absolutely necessary data or we may send you advertising. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO (consent) therefore applies.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">We also have a legitimate interest to know who we are dealing with in order to contact in certain cases. In addition, we need to know who is using our services and whether they are being used as specified in our terms of use, so Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO (Legitimate Interests) applies.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Note: the following sections are to be ticked by users (as needed):</p>

<strong class="impressum__text">Registration with clear name</strong>.
</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<span class="impressum__text" style="font-weight: 400">Because in business we need to know with whom we are dealing, registration is only possible with your real name (clear name) and not with pseudonyms.</span>
</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Registration with pseudonyms</strong>.
</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<span class="impressum__text" style="font-weight: 400">Pseudonyms can be used during registration, which means that you do not have to register with us with your real name. This ensures that your name can not be processed by us. </span>
</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Storage of IP address</strong>.
</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<span class="impressum__text" style="font-weight: 400">In the course of registration, login and account use, we store the IP address in the background for security reasons, in order to be able to determine the lawful use.</span>.

<h3 class="impressum__text">What is web hosting?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">When you visit websites nowadays, certain information &#8211; including personal data &#8211; is automatically created and stored, including on this website. This data should be processed as sparingly as possible and only with justification. By the way, by website we mean the totality of all web pages on a domain, i.e. everything from the home page (homepage) to the very last sub-page (like this one). By domain we mean, for example, example.de or sampleexample.com.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">When you want to view a website on a computer, tablet, or smartphone, you use a program called a web browser to do so. You probably know some web browsers by name: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. We say browser or web browser for short.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">In order to display the website, the browser must connect to another computer where the website's code is stored: the web server. Operating a web server is a complicated and costly task, which is why this is usually done by professional providers, the providers. These offer web hosting and thus ensure reliable and error-free storage of website data. A whole lot of technical terms, but please stay tuned, it gets better!</p>
<p class="impressum__text">When the browser on your computer (desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone) connects and during data transfer to and from the web server, personal data may be processed. On the one hand, your computer stores data, on the other hand, the web server must also store data for a while to ensure proper operation.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">A picture is worth a thousand words, so the following graphic illustrates the interaction between the browser, the Internet and the hosting provider.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<img role="img" src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/browser-und-webserver.svg" alt="Browser and web server" width="100%" />
</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we process personal data?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">The purposes of data processing are:</p>
<ol>
<li class="impressum__text">Professional hosting of the website and securing its operation</li>.
<li class="impressum__text">to maintain operational and IT security</li>.
<li class="impressum__text">Anonymous evaluation of access behavior to improve our offer and, if necessary, for law enforcement or prosecution of claims</li>.
</ol>
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is processed?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Even while you are visiting our website right now, our web server, which is the computer on which this website is stored, usually automatically stores data such as</p>.
<ul class="impressum__text">
<li class="impressum__text">the complete Internet address (URL) of the accessed web page</li>.
<li class="impressum__text">Browser and browser version (e.g. Chrome 87)</li>
<li class="impressum__text">the operating system used (e.g. Windows 10)</li>
<li class="impressum__text">the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL) (e.g. <a class="impressum__text" href="https://www.beispielquellsite.de/vondabinichgekommen/" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">https://www.beispielquellsite.de/vondabinichgekommen/</a>)</li>
<li class="impressum__text">the hostname and IP address of the device being accessed from (e.g. COMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121)</li>
<li class="impressum__text">date and time</li>
<li class="impressum__text">in files called web server log files</li>.
</ul>
<h3 class="impressum__text">How long is data stored?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">As a rule, the above data is stored for two weeks and then automatically deleted. We do not pass on this data, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this data may be viewed by authorities in the event of unlawful conduct.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">In short:</strong> Your visit will be logged by our provider (company that runs our website on special computers (servers)), but we will not share your data without your consent!</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">The lawfulness of the processing of personal data in the context of web hosting results from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO (protection of legitimate interests), because the use of professional hosting with a provider is necessary to present the company on the Internet in a secure and user-friendly manner and to be able to pursue attacks and claims from this, if necessary.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">As a rule, there is a contract on commissioned processing between us and the hosting provider in accordance with Art. 28 f. DSGVO, which ensures compliance with data protection and guarantees data security.</p>

<h3 class="impressum__text">What is Social Media?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">In addition to our website, we are also active on various social media platforms. In this context, user data may be processed so that we can target users who are interested in us via the social networks. In addition, elements of a social media platform may also be embedded directly in our website. This is the case, for example, when you click on a so-called social button on our website and are redirected directly to our social media presence. So-called social media or social media are websites and apps through which registered members can produce content, share content openly or in specific groups, and network with other members.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use social media?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">For years, social media platforms have been the place where people communicate and get in touch online. Our social media presences allow us to bring our products and services closer to prospective customers. The social media elements embedded on our website help you to be able to switch to our social media content quickly and without complications.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">The data that is stored and processed through your use of a social media channel is primarily for the purpose of being able to perform web analyses. The aim of these analyses is to be able to develop more precise and personalized marketing and advertising strategies. Depending on your behavior on a social media platform, appropriate conclusions can be drawn about your interests with the help of the evaluated data and so-called user profiles can be created. This also enables the platforms to present you with tailored advertisements. For this purpose, cookies are usually set in your browser, which store data about your usage behavior.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">We generally assume that we remain responsible under data protection law, even if we use services of a social media platform. However, the European Court of Justice has ruled that in certain cases the operator of the social media platform may be jointly responsible with us within the meaning of Art. 26 DSGVO. Insofar as this is the case, we point this out separately and work on the basis of an agreement in this regard. The essence of the agreement is then reproduced below for the platform concerned.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Please note that when you use the social media platforms or our built-in elements, data about you may also be processed outside the European Union, as many social media channels, for example Facebook or Twitter, are American companies. This may make it less easy for you to claim or enforce your rights regarding your personal data.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is processed?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Which data exactly is stored and processed depends on the respective provider of the social media platform. But usually it is data such as phone numbers, email addresses, data you enter in a contact form, user data such as which buttons you click, who you like or follow, when you visited which pages, information about your device and your IP address. Most of this data is stored in cookies. Especially if you yourself have a profile on the visited social media channel and are logged in, data can be linked to your profile.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">All data that is collected via a social media platform is also stored on the servers of the providers. Thus, only the providers also have access to the data and can give you the appropriate information or make changes.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">If you want to know exactly what data is stored and processed by the social media providers and how you can object to the data processing, you should carefully read the respective privacy policy of the company. Also, if you have questions about data storage and data processing or want to assert corresponding rights, we recommend that you contact the provider directly.</p>

</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We will inform you about the duration of data processing below, provided we have further information on this. For example, the social media platform Facebook stores data until it is no longer needed for its own purpose. However, customer data that is matched with our own user data is already deleted within two days. In general, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. If it is required by law, as in the case of accounting, for example, this storage period may also be exceeded.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Widerspruchsrecht</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">You also have the right and the possibility to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers such as embedded social media elements at any time. This works either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data collection through cookies by managing, disabling or deleting cookies in your browser.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Since social media tools may use cookies, we also recommend that you read our general privacy policy on cookies. To find out exactly which of your data is stored and processed, you should read the privacy statements of the respective tools.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">If you have consented that data from you can be processed and stored by integrated social media elements, this consent is considered the legal basis for data processing <strong class="impressum__text">(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO)</strong>. In principle, if consent is given, your data will also be stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest <strong class="impressum__text">(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO)</strong> in fast and good communication with you or other customers and business partners. Nevertheless, we use the tools only insofar as you have given consent. Most social media platforms also set cookies in your browser to store data. That is why we recommend that you read our privacy text about cookies carefully and view the privacy policy or cookie policy of the respective service provider.</p>.

<h3 class="impressum__text">What are Facebook tools?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We use selected tools from Facebook on our website. Facebook is a social media network of the company Meta Platforms Inc. or for the European area of the company Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. With the help of these tools we can offer you and people who are interested in our products and services the best possible offer.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">If data is collected from you and forwarded via our embedded Facebook elements or via our Facebook page (Fanpage), both we and Facebook Ireland Ltd. are responsible for this. Facebook is solely responsible for the further processing of this data. Our joint obligations have also been embodied in a publicly available agreement at <a class="impressum__text" href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum">https://www.facebook.com/legal/controller_addendum</a>. This states, for example, that we must clearly inform you about the use of Facebook tools on our site. Furthermore, we are also responsible for ensuring that the tools are securely integrated into our website in accordance with data protection law. Facebook, on the other hand, is responsible for the data security of Facebook products, for example. If you have any questions about data collection and data processing by Facebook, you can contact the company directly. If you direct the question to us, we are obligated to forward it to Facebook.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">In the following, we provide an overview of the various Facebook tools, what data is sent to Facebook and how you can delete this data.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Among many other products, Facebook also offers the so-called &#8220;Facebook Business Tools&#8221;. This is the official name of Facebook. However, since the term is hardly known, we have decided to call them simply Facebook Tools. Among them are:</p>
<ul class="impressum__text">
<li class="impressum__text">Facebook pixel</li>
<li class="impressum__text">social plug-ins (such as the "Like" or "Share" button)</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Facebook Login</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Account Kit</li>
<li class="impressum__text">APIs (Application Programming Interface)</li>
<li class="impressum__text">SDKs (collection of programming tools)</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Platform Integrations</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Plugins</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Codes</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Specifications</li>
<li class="impressum__text">Documentations</li>
<li class="impressum__text">technologies and services</li>.
</ul>
<p class="impressum__text">Through these tools, Facebook is expanding services and has the ability to obtain information about user activity outside of Facebook.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use Facebook tools on our website?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We only want to show our services and products to people who are really interested in them. With the help of advertisements (Facebook ads), we can reach precisely these people. However, in order to show users suitable advertising, Facebook needs information about people's wishes and needs. Thus, information about user behavior (and contact data) on our website is made available to the company. As a result, Facebook collects better user data and can show interested people the appropriate advertising about our products or services. The tools thus enable tailored advertising campaigns on Facebook.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Data about your behavior on our website is called "event data" by Facebook. This is also used for measurement and analysis services. Facebook can thus create "campaign reports" on our behalf about the impact of our advertising campaigns. Furthermore, analytics give us better insight into how you use our services, website or products. As a result, we use some of these tools to optimize your user experience on our website. For example, social plug-ins allow you to share content on our site directly on Facebook.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is stored by Facebook tools?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">By using individual Facebook tools, personal data (customer data) can be sent to Facebook. Depending on the tools used, customer data such as name, address, phone number and IP address may be sent.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Facebook uses this information to match the data it itself has from you (if you are a Facebook member). Before customer data is transmitted to Facebook, a process known as "hashing" takes place. This means that a data record of any size is transformed into a character string. This also serves to encrypt data.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">In addition to contact data, "event data" is also transmitted. Event data" means the information that we receive about you on our website. For example, which subpages you visit or which products you buy from us. Facebook does not share the information it receives with third parties (such as advertisers) unless it has explicit permission or is legally required to do so. "Event data" may also be associated with contact information. This allows Facebook to offer better personalized advertising. After the aforementioned matching process, Facebook deletes the contact data again.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">In order to deliver ads in an optimized manner, Facebook uses Event Data only when it has been aggregated with other data (collected by Facebook in other ways). Facebook also uses this event data for security, privacy, development, and research purposes. Much of this data is transferred to Facebook via cookies. Cookies are small text files used to store data or information in browsers. Depending on the tools you use and whether you are a Facebook member, different numbers of cookies are created in your browser. We go into more detail about individual Facebook cookies in the descriptions of each Facebook tool. You can also learn general information about Facebook's use of cookies at <a class="impressum__text" href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies?tid=322365556">https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies</a>.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">In principle, Facebook stores data until it is no longer needed for its own services and Facebook products. Facebook has servers spread around the world where its data is stored. Customer data, however, is deleted within 48 hours after it has been matched with its own user data.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">In accordance with the Basic Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to information, correction, portability and deletion of your data.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Complete deletion of data only occurs if you delete your Facebook account completely. And this is how deleting your Facebook account works:</p>
<p class="impressum__text">1) Click Settings on the right side of Facebook.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">2) Then click on "Your Facebook Information" in the left column.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">3) Now click &#8220;Deactivation and deletion&#8221;.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">4) Now select "Delete account" and then click "Next and delete account"</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">5) Now enter your password, click "Next" and then click "Delete account"</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">The storage of data that Facebook receives via our site is done, among other things, via cookies (e.g. for social plugins). In your browser, you can disable, delete or manage individual or all cookies. Depending on which browser you use, this works in different ways. Under the section "Cookies" you will find the corresponding links to the respective instructions of the most popular browsers.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">If you do not want cookies in principle, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. This way you can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow it or not.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">If you have consented that data from you can be processed and stored by embedded Facebook tools, this consent is considered the legal basis for data processing <strong class="impressum__text">(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO)</strong>. In principle, your data will also be stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest <strong class="impressum__text">(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO)</strong> in a fast and good communication with you or other customers and business partners. Nevertheless, we use the tools only insofar as you have given consent. Most social media platforms also set cookies in your browser to store data. That is why we recommend that you read our privacy text about cookies carefully and view Facebook's privacy policy or cookie policy.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Facebook also processes data from you in the USA, among other places. We would like to point out that according to the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for the transfer of data to the USA. This may be associated with various risks for the legality and security of data processing.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">As a basis for data processing with recipients located in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, i.e. in particular in the USA) or a data transfer there, Facebook uses so-called standard contractual clauses (= Art. 46. para. 2 and 3 DSGVO). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are templates provided by the EU Commission and are intended to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards even if it is transferred to third countries (such as the USA) and stored there. Through these clauses, Facebook undertakes to comply with the European level of data protection when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed and managed in the US. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding standard contractual clauses here, among other places: <a class="impressum__text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?locale=de" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?locale=de</a>

<h2 id="facebook-social-plug-ins-privacy-clause" class="impressum__text">Facebook Social Plug-ins Privacy Policy</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">So-called social plug-ins of the company Meta Platforms Inc. are installed on our website. You can recognize these buttons by the classic Facebook logo, such as the "Like" button (the hand with raised thumb) or by a clear "Facebook Plug-in" label. A social plug-in is a small part of Facebook that is integrated into our site. Each plug-in has its own function. The most commonly used functions are the well-known &#8220;Like&#8221;and &#8220;Share&#8221;buttons.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">The following social plug-ins are offered by Facebook:</p>
<ul class="impressum__text">

<h3 class="impressum__text">What is Instagram?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We have integrated Instagram functions on our website. Instagram is a social media platform of the company Instagram LLC, 1601 Willow Rd, Menlo Park CA 94025, USA. Instagram has been a subsidiary of Meta Platforms Inc. since 2012 and is one of Facebook's products. Embedding Instagram content on our website is called embedding. This allows us to show you content such as buttons, photos or videos from Instagram directly on our website. When you call up web pages on our website that have an Instagram function integrated, data is transmitted to Instagram, stored and processed. Instagram uses the same systems and technologies as Facebook. Your data is thus processed across all Facebook companies.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">In the following, we want to give you a more detailed insight into why Instagram collects data, what kind of data it is and how you can largely control the data processing. Since Instagram belongs to Meta Platforms Inc., we obtain our information on the one hand from the Instagram policies, but on the other hand also from the Meta Privacy Policy itself.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Instagram is one of the most popular social media networks in the world. Instagram combines the advantages of a blog with those of audiovisual platforms like YouTube or Vimeo. You can upload photos and short videos on "Insta" (as many of the users casually call the platform), edit them with various filters and also distribute them on other social networks. And if you don't want to be active yourself, you can also just follow other interesting users.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use Instagram on our website?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Instagram is the social media platform that has really gone through the roof in recent years. And of course we have also responded to this boom. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible on our website. That's why a varied preparation of our content is a matter of course for us. Through the embedded Instagram features, we can enrich our content with helpful, funny or exciting content from the Instagram world. Since Instagram is a subsidiary of Facebook, the data collected can also serve us for personalized advertising on Facebook. This way, only people who are really interested in our products or services get our ads.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Instagram also uses the collected data for measurement and analysis purposes. We get aggregate statistics and thus more insight about your desires and interests. It is important to note that these reports do not identify you personally.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is stored by Instagram?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">When you come across one of our pages that have Instagram features (such as Instagram images or plug-ins) built in, your browser automatically connects to Instagram's servers. In the process, data is sent to Instagram, stored and processed. And this is regardless of whether you have an Instagram account or not. This includes information about our website, about your computer, about purchases made, about advertisements you see and how you use our offer. Furthermore, the date and time of your interaction with Instagram is also stored. If you have an Instagram account or are logged in, Instagram stores significantly more data about you.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Facebook distinguishes between customer data and event data. We assume that this is exactly the same for Instagram. Customer data are, for example, name, address, phone number and IP address. These customer data will only be transmitted to Instagram if they have been "hashed" beforehand. Hashing means that a data record is transformed into a character string. This makes it possible to encrypt the contact data. In addition, the "event data" mentioned above is also transmitted. By "event data" Facebook - and consequently Instagram - understands data about your user behavior. It may also happen that contact data is combined with event data. The collected contact data will be matched with the data Instagram already has from you.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Through small text files (cookies), which are usually set in your browser, the collected data is transmitted to Facebook. Depending on the Instagram functions used and whether you yourself have an Instagram account, different amounts of data are stored.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">We assume that Instagram's data processing works the same as Facebook's. This means that if you have an Instagram account or have visited <a class="impressum__text" href="https://www.instagram.com/?tid=322365556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.instagram.com</a>, Instagram has at least set a cookie. If this is the case, your browser sends info to Instagram via the cookie as soon as you come into contact with an Instagram function. At the latest after 90 days (after matching), this data is deleted again or anonymized. Although we have intensively studied the data processing of Instagram, we can not say exactly what data Instagram collects and stores.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">In the following, we will show you cookies that are set in your browser at least when you click on an Instagram feature (such as button or an Insta image). In our test, we assume that you do not have an Instagram account. If you are logged in to Instagram, of course, significantly more cookies are set in your browser.</p>.

<h3 class="impressum__text">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Instagram shares the information it receives between Facebook companies with external partners and with people you connect with around the world. The data processing is done in compliance with its own data policy. Your data is distributed on Facebook servers around the world, in part for security reasons. Most of these servers are located in the USA.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Thanks to the Basic Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to information, portability, correction and deletion of your data. You can manage your data in the Instagram settings. If you want to completely delete your data on Instagram, you must permanently delete your Instagram account.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">And this is how the deletion of the Instagram account works:</p>
<p class="impressum__text">First, open the Instagram app. On your profile page, go down and click on "Help section". Now you will get to the company's website. On the web page, click "Manage your account" and then click "Delete your account."</p>
<p class="impressum__text">If you delete your account entirely, Instagram will delete posts such as your photos and status updates. Information that other people have shared about you does not belong to your account, and consequently will not be deleted.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">As mentioned above, Instagram stores your data primarily via cookies. You can manage, disable or delete these cookies in your browser. Depending on your browser, the management always works a bit differently. Under the section "Cookies" you will find the corresponding links to the respective instructions of the most popular browsers.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">You can also basically set up your browser so that you are always informed when a cookie is to be set. Then you can always decide individually whether you want to allow the cookie or not.</p>.

<h3 class="impressum__text">What is Twitter?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We have integrated Twitter functions on our website. These are, for example, embedded tweets, timelines, buttons or hashtags. Twitter is a short message service and a social media platform of the company Twitter Inc, One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2 D02 AX07, Ireland.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">To our knowledge, in the European Economic Area and in Switzerland, no personal data or data about your web activities are transmitted to Twitter by the mere inclusion of Twitter functions. Only when you interact with the Twitter functions, such as clicking on a button, can data be sent to Twitter, stored there and processed. We have no influence on this data processing and bear no responsibility for it. Within the framework of this privacy policy, we want to give you an overview of what data Twitter stores, what Twitter does with this data and how you can protect yourself from the data transfer to a large extent.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">For some, Twitter is a news service, for others a social media platform, and still others speak of a microblogging service. All these terms have their justification and mean more or less the same thing.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Both private individuals and companies use Twitter to communicate with interested people via short messages. Twitter allows only 280 characters per message. These messages are called "tweets. Unlike Facebook, for example, the service does not focus on expanding a network for &#8220;friends&#8221; but wants to be understood as a worldwide and open news platform. On Twitter, it is also possible to have an anonymous account, and tweets can be deleted by the company on the one hand, and by the users themselves on the other.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use Twitter on our website?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Like many other websites and companies, we try to offer our services and communicate with our customers through various channels. Especially Twitter has grown on us as a useful "little" news service. Again and again we tweet or retweet exciting, funny or interesting content. We realize that you can't follow every channel separately. After all, you also have something else to do. That's why we have included Twitter functions on our website. You can follow our Twitter activity "on the spot" or follow a direct link to our Twitter page. Through the integration, we want to strengthen our service and user-friendliness on our website.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is stored by Twitter?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">On some of our subpages you will find the built-in Twitter functions. When you interact with the Twitter content, such as clicking on a button, Twitter may collect and store data. And this is the case even if you do not have a Twitter account yourself. Twitter calls this data &#8220;log data&#8221;. This includes demographic data, browser cookie IDs, your smartphone ID, hashed email addresses, and information about which pages you have visited on Twitter and what actions you have taken. Twitter, of course, stores more data if you have a Twitter account and are logged in. Most of the time, this storage happens via cookies. Cookies are small text files that are usually set in your browser and transmit different information to Twitter.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">We will now show you which cookies are set when you are not logged in to Twitter but visit a website with built-in Twitter features. Please consider this list as an example. We can in no way guarantee a claim to completeness here, as the choice of cookies always changes and depends on your individual actions with Twitter content.</p>.

<p class="impressum__text">Twitter uses the collected data on the one hand to better understand user behavior and thus improve its own services and advertising offers, on the other hand, the data also serve internal security measures.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">When Twitter collects data from other websites, it is deleted, aggregated, or otherwise obscured after a maximum of 30 days. The Twitter servers are located on various server centers in the United States. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the collected data is collected and stored in America. After our research, we could not clearly determine whether Twitter also has its own servers in Europe. Basically, Twitter can store the collected data until it is no longer useful to the company, you delete the data or there is a legal deletion period.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Twitter repeatedly emphasizes in its privacy policy that it does not store data from external website visits if you or your browser are located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. However, if you interact with Twitter directly, Twitter will of course store data about you.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">If you have a Twitter account, you can manage your data by clicking "More" under the "Profile" button. Then click on "Settings and privacy". Here you can manage the data processing individually.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">If you don't have a Twitter account, you can go to <a class="impressum__text" href="https://twitter.com/">twitter.com</a> and then click on "Individualization". Under the item "Individualization and data" you can manage your collected data.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Most data is stored via cookies, as mentioned above, and you can manage, disable or delete them in your browser. Please note that you only &#8220;edit the cookies in the browser you have chosen&#8221;. This means: if you use a different browser in the future, you will have to manage your cookies there again according to your wishes. Under the section "Cookies" you will find the corresponding links to the respective instructions of the most popular browsers.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">You can also manage your browser so that you are informed for each individual cookie. Then you can always decide individually whether you allow a cookie or not.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Twitter also uses the data for personalized advertising inside and outside Twitter.

<h3 class="impressum__text">What are cloud services?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Cloud services provide us as website operators with storage space and computing power via the Internet. Via the Internet, data can be transferred to an external system, processed and stored. The corresponding cloud provider takes over the management of this data. Depending on the requirements, an individual person or even a company can choose the storage space size or computing power. Cloud storage is accessed via an API or via storage protocols. API stands for Application Programming Interface, which means a programming interface that connects software with hardware components.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use cloud services?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We use cloud services for several reasons. A cloud service offers us the possibility to store our data securely. In addition, we can access the data from different locations and devices, giving us more flexibility and making our work processes easier. A cloud storage also saves us money because we don't have to build and manage our own infrastructure for data storage and data security. By storing our data centrally in the cloud, we can also expand our fields of application and manage our information much better.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">So, as a website operator or as a company, we primarily use cloud services for our own purposes. For example, we use the services to manage our calendar, to store documents or other important information in the cloud. However, personal data about you may also be stored in the process. This is the case, for example, if you provide us with your contact details (such as name and email address) and we store our customer data with a cloud provider. Consequently, data that we process from you may also be stored and processed on external servers. If we offer certain forms or content from cloud services on our website, cookies may also be set for web analytics and advertising purposes. Furthermore, such cookies remember your settings (such as the language used) so that the next time you visit our website you will find your familiar web environment.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is processed by cloud services?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Much of the data we store in the cloud has no personal reference, but some data counts as personal data according to the definition of the GDPR. This is often customer data such as name, address, IP address or telephone number or technical device information. Furthermore, videos, images and audio files can also be stored in the cloud. Exactly how the data is collected and stored depends on the service in question. We try to use only services that are very trustworthy and professional with the data. Basically, the services, such as Amazon Drive, have access to the stored files in order to offer their own service accordingly. For this, however, the services need permissions, such as the right to copy files because of security aspects. This data is processed and managed within the scope of the services and in compliance with the applicable laws. This also includes the DSGVO for US providers (via the standard contractual clauses). These cloud services also work in some cases with third-party providers who may process data under instruction and in accordance with the privacy policy and further security measures. We would like to emphasize again at this point that all known cloud services (such as Amazon Drive, Google Drive or Microsoft Onedrive) obtain the right to have access to stored content in order to be able to offer and optimize their own service accordingly.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Duration of data processing</h3>.
<p class="impressum__text">We will inform you about the duration of data processing below, if we have further information on this. In general, cloud services store data until you or we revoke the data storage or delete the data again. In general, personal data is only stored as long as it is absolutely necessary for the provision of the services. However, a final data deletion from the cloud may take several months. This is the case because the data is usually not only stored on one server, but is distributed on different servers.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Widerspruchsrecht</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">You also have the right and the possibility to revoke your consent to data storage in a cloud at any time. If cookies are used, you also have a right of revocation here. This works either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data collection through cookies by managing, deactivating or deleting cookies in your browser. We also recommend that you read our general privacy policy on cookies. To find out exactly what data is stored and processed by you, you should read the privacy statements of the respective cloud providers.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We use cloud services mainly on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) in a good security and storage system.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Certain processing, in particular the use of cookies and the use of storage functions require your consent. If you have consented that data from you can be processed and stored at cloud services, this consent is considered the legal basis of the data processing (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). Most of the services we use set cookies in your browser to store data. That is why we recommend that you read our privacy text about cookies carefully and view the privacy policy or cookie policy of the respective service provider.</p>.

<h3 class="impressum__text">What are audio and video elements?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We have included audio or video elements on our website so that you can watch videos or listen to music/podcasts directly via our website. The content is provided by service providers. All content is therefore also obtained from the corresponding servers of the providers.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">These are integrated functional elements of platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo or Spotify. The use of these portals is usually free of charge, but paid content can also be published. With the help of these embedded elements, you can listen to or view the respective content via our website.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">When you use audio or video elements on our website, personal data about you may also be transmitted to, processed and stored by the service providers.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use audio &amp; video elements on our website?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Of course we want to provide you with the best offer on our website. And we realize that content is no longer conveyed merely in text and static images. Instead of just giving you a link to a video, we offer audio and video formats directly on our website that are entertaining or informative and ideally even both. This expands our service and makes it easier for you to access interesting content. Thus, in addition to our text and images, we also offer video and/or audio content.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is stored by audio &amp; video elements?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">When you access a page on our website that has an embedded video, for example, your server connects to the service provider's server. In the process, data from you is also transferred to the third-party provider and stored there. Some data is collected and stored quite independently of whether or not you have an account with the third-party provider. This usually includes your IP address, browser type, operating system, and other general information about your terminal device. Furthermore, most providers also collect information about your web activity. This includes session duration, bounce rate, which button you clicked on, or which website you used to access the service. All this information is usually stored via cookies or pixel tags (also called web beacons). Pseudonymized data is mostly stored in cookies in your browser. You can always find out exactly what data is stored and processed in the privacy policy of the respective provider.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Duration of data processing</h3>.
<p class="impressum__text">You can find out exactly how long the data is stored on the servers of the third-party providers either below in the privacy text of the respective tool or in the privacy policy of the provider. In principle, personal data is only processed for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services or products. As a rule, this also applies to third-party providers. In most cases, you can assume that certain data will be stored on the servers of third-party providers for several years. Data can be stored for different lengths of time specifically in cookies. Some cookies are already deleted after leaving the website, others can be stored in your browser for several years.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Widerspruchsrecht</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">You also have the right and the possibility to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time. This works either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can also prevent data collection through cookies by managing, disabling or deleting cookies in your browser. The lawfulness of the processing until the revocation remains unaffected.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Since the embedded audio and video functions on our site usually also use cookies, you should also read our general privacy policy on cookies. In the privacy statements of the respective third-party providers you can learn more about the handling and storage of your data.</p>.

<h3 class="impressum__text">What is YouTube?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We have included YouTube videos on our website. So we can present you interesting videos directly on our site. YouTube is a video portal that has been a subsidiary of Google since 2006. The video portal is operated by YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. When you call up a page on our website that has a YouTube video embedded, your browser automatically connects to the YouTube or Google servers. In the process, various data are transferred (depending on the settings). Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all data processing in the European area.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">In the following, we would like to explain in more detail what data is processed, why we have embedded YouTube videos and how you can manage or delete your data.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">On YouTube, users can watch, rate, comment on and upload videos themselves free of charge. Over the past few years, YouTube has become one of the most important social media channels in the world. In order for us to display videos on our website, YouTube provides a code snippet that we have built into our site.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use YouTube videos on our website?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">YouTube is the video platform with the most visitors and the best content. We are committed to providing you with the best possible user experience on our website. And of course, interesting videos can not be missing. With the help of our embedded videos, we provide you with other helpful content in addition to our texts and images. In addition, the embedded videos make our website easier to find on the Google search engine. Also, when we run ads via Google Ads, Google - thanks to the collected data - can really only show these ads to people who are interested in what we have to offer.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is stored by YouTube?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">As soon as you visit one of our pages that has a YouTube video embedded, YouTube sets at least one cookie that stores your IP address and our URL. If you are logged into your YouTube account, YouTube can assign your interactions on our website to your profile, usually with the help of cookies. This includes data such as session duration, bounce rate, approximate location, technical information such as browser type, screen resolution or your internet provider. Other data may include contact details, any ratings, sharing of content via social media or adding to your favorites on YouTube.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">When you are not signed into a Google Account or YouTube account, Google stores data with a unique identifier associated with your device, browser, or app. For example, your preferred language setting is retained. But a lot of interaction data can't be stored because fewer cookies are set.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">In the following list we show cookies that were set in a test in the browser. On the one hand, we show cookies that are set without a logged-in YouTube account. On the other hand, we show cookies that are set with a logged-in account. The list cannot claim to be complete, because the user data always depends on the interactions on YouTube.</p>.

<h3 class="impressum__text">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">The data that YouTube receives from you and processes is stored on Google servers. Most of these servers are located in America. At <a class="impressum__text" href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=de</a> you can see exactly where Google's data centers are located. Your data is distributed across the servers. This means that the data can be accessed more quickly and is better protected from manipulation.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">The collected data is stored by Google for different lengths of time. Some data you can delete at any time, others are automatically deleted after a limited time, and still others are stored by Google for a longer period of time. Some data (such as items from "My Activity", photos or documents, products) stored in your Google Account will remain stored until you delete it. Even if you are not signed into a Google account, you can delete some data associated with your device, browser, or app.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Generally, you can manually delete data in Google Account. With the automatic deletion function of location and activity data introduced in 2019, information is stored depending on your decision &#8211; either 3 or 18 months and then deleted.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Whether you have a Google account or not, you can configure your browser to delete or disable cookies from Google. Depending on which browser you use, this works in different ways. Under the section "Cookies" you will find the corresponding links to the respective instructions of the most popular browsers.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">If you do not want cookies in principle, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. This way you can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow it or not.</p>.

<p class="impressum__text">If you have consented that data from you can be processed and stored by embedded YouTube elements, this consent is considered the legal basis for data processing <strong class="impressum__text">(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO)</strong>. In principle, your data will also be stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest <strong class="impressum__text">(Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO)</strong> in a fast and good communication with you or other customers and business partners. Nevertheless, we only use the embedded YouTube elements insofar as you have given your consent. YouTube also sets cookies in your browser to store data. That is why we recommend that you read our privacy text about cookies carefully and view the privacy policy or cookie policy of the respective service provider.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">YouTube also processes data in the USA, among other places. We would like to point out that according to the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for the transfer of data to the USA. This may be associated with various risks for the legality and security of data processing.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">As a basis for data processing at recipients located in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, i.e. in particular in the USA) or a data transfer there, YouTube uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission (= Art. 46. para. 2 and 3 DSGVO). These clauses oblige YouTube to comply with the EU level of data protection when processing relevant data outside the EU as well. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the clauses here, among other places: <a class="impressum__text" href="https://germany.representation.ec.europa.eu/index_de" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">https://germany.representation.ec.europa.eu/index_de</a>.</p>

<h3 class="impressum__text">What is web design?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We use several tools on our website that serve our web design. Web design is not, as often assumed, only about that our website looks pretty, but also about functionality and performance. But of course, the appropriate appearance of a website is also one of the major goals of professional web design. Web design is a branch of media design and deals with the visual as well as the structural and functional design of a website. The goal is to use web design to improve your experience on our website. In web design jargon, this is referred to as user experience (UX) and usability. User experience refers to all impressions and experiences that the website visitor experiences on a website. Usability is a sub-item of user experience. This refers to the user-friendliness of a website. The main emphasis here is on ensuring that content, subpages or products are clearly structured and that you can easily and quickly find what you are looking for. In order to provide you with the best possible experience on our website, we also use so-called third-party web design tools. In this privacy policy, the category "web design" therefore includes all services that improve the design of our website. These can be, for example, fonts, various plugins or other integrated web design functions.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use web design tools?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">How you absorb information on a website depends very much on the structure, functionality and visual perception of the website. Therefore, a good and professional web design became more and more important for us as well. We are constantly working on the improvement of our website and see this also as an extended service for you as a website visitor. Furthermore, a beautiful and functioning website also has economic advantages for us. After all, you will only visit us and take advantage of our offers if you feel completely comfortable.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is stored by web design tools?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">When you visit our website, web design elements may be embedded in our pages that can also process data. What data it is exactly, of course, depends largely on the tools used. Further below you can see exactly which tools we use for our website. We recommend that you also read the respective privacy policy of the tools used for more detailed information on data processing. In most cases, you will find out there which data is processed, whether cookies are used and how long the data is stored. Through fonts such as Google Fonts, for example, information such as language settings, IP address, browser version, browser screen resolution and browser name are also automatically transmitted to the Google servers.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Duration of data processing</h3>.
<p class="impressum__text">How long data is processed is very individual and depends on the web design elements used. For example, if cookies are used, the retention period can be as short as a minute or as long as a few years. Please make yourself clear in this regard. For this purpose, we recommend on the one hand our general text section on cookies, as well as the privacy statements of the tools used. There you will usually find out exactly which cookies are used and what information is stored in them. Google font files, for example, are stored for one year. This is to improve the loading time of a website. In principle, data is only ever stored for as long as is necessary for the provision of the service. In the case of legal requirements, data can also be stored for longer.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Widerspruchsrecht</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">You also have the right and the possibility to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time. This works either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. You can also prevent data collection through cookies by managing, disabling or deleting cookies in your browser. However, under web design elements (mostly fonts), there is also data that cannot be deleted quite so easily. This is the case when data is automatically collected directly when a page is called up and transmitted to a third-party provider (such as Google). In this case, please contact the support of the respective provider. In the case of Google, you can reach support at <a class="impressum__text" href="https://support.google.com/?hl=de">https://support.google.com/?hl=de</a>.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">If you have consented that web design tools may be used, the legal basis of the corresponding data processing is this consent. According to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO (consent), this consent constitutes the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as may occur during the collection by web design tools. From our side, there is also a legitimate interest to improve the web design on our website. After all, only then can we provide you with a beautiful and professional web offer. The corresponding legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO (Legitimate Interests). Nevertheless, we only use web design tools insofar as you have given your consent. In any case, we would like to emphasize this again here.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">For information on specific web design tools, see &#8211; the following sections, if available &#8211;.
<h2 id="google-fonts-local-privacy-policy" class="impressum__text">Google Fonts Local Privacy Policy</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">On our website, we use Google Fonts from the company Google Inc. For the European area, the company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible. We have integrated the Google fonts locally, i.e. on our web server &#8211; not on the servers of Google &#8211;. Thus, there is no connection to Google servers and therefore no data transmission or storage.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">What are Google Fonts?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">In the past, Google Fonts was also called Google Web Fonts. This is an interactive directory of over 800 fonts that <a class="impressum__text" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC?tid=322365556">Google</a> provides for free. With Google Fonts, you could use fonts without uploading them to your own server. But to prevent any information transfer to Google servers in this regard, we have downloaded the fonts to our server. This way we act privacy compliant and do not send any data to Google Fonts.</p>

<h3 class="impressum__text">What is a content search provider?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Meanwhile, we have already published a lot of content on our website. And of course we don't want it to be forgotten just because it can't be found. That's why we use a content search provider on our website. You're probably familiar with major search engines like Google. Content search providers are basically also search engines, but unlike Google, they don't search the entire web for content, but only the website you are on. Using a text field, you can enter terms that match the content you are looking for, and the search program will find the articles you are looking for. If you use the integrated search function, personal data about you may also be processed.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use a content search provider?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">When you look around our website, you will quickly notice how much useful content we have already published over the years. There are real treasures among them and we want you to find them quickly without having to click around for a long time. With a content search feature right on our website, you can quickly and easily find the content you're looking for using keywords that match the topic you're looking for. This feature is really handy and we also see it as our task to make your life on our website as pleasant and helpful as possible. That's why we decided to include a content search program in our website.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is processed?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">When you use the search function on our website, the integrated content search provider (such as Algolia Places or Giphy) may automatically receive and store data from you. This is technical data about your browser as well as data such as your IP address, device ID and the search terms you entered. Please note that IP addresses are personal data. The privacy statements of the providers state that this information is collected and stored in order to increase security and improve their own services. The automatically collected usage data, which does not include personal data and is processed in anonymized form, can also be used for analysis purposes. Some providers also pass on this anonymized data to third parties. In order to find out more about this, we recommend that you read the specific data protection declarations of the individual providers carefully. In order for the services to function properly, cookies are also usually set in your browser. You can learn more about cookies in our general section "Cookies". Whether and which cookies the individual search tools use, you can find out - if available - below or in the corresponding privacy statements of the integrated tools.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Generally, each content search provider processes different data. Therefore, this general section cannot specifically address the data processing of the individual tools. However, usually the services store personal data only as long as it is necessary for the smooth functioning of the tools. Some services (such as Giphy) also retain personal data longer if required by legal obligations. In depersonalized form, data is retained longer by most providers as well. Content search providers may also use cookies to store various data. You can read more about this in our general section on cookies. If you want to know about the specific cookies that a search provider uses, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the providers we use. In most cases, you will find an exemplary list of the cookies used there.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Widerspruchsrecht</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Always be aware: if you do not want, no personal data of yours may be processed. Always have the right to access your personal data and object to its use. You can also revoke your consent at any time via the cookie consent tool or via other opt-out options. You can also easily manage, delete or deactivate used cookies yourself via your browser. If you delete cookies, it could be that some functions of the tool no longer work. So please do not be surprised about that. How you manage cookies in your browser also depends on the browser you use. In the section "Cookies" you can also find links to the instructions of the most important browsers.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">If you have consented to the use of a content search provider, the legal basis for the corresponding data processing is this consent. According to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO (consent), this consent constitutes the legal basis for the processing of personal data as it may occur during the collection by a content search provider.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">We also have a legitimate interest to use a content search provider to optimize our service on our website. The corresponding legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO (Legitimate Interests). However, we only ever use a content search provider if you have given your consent. We definitely want to have this stated again at this point.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">Information on specific content search providers is provided &#8211; where available &#8211; in the following sections.</p>

<h3 class="impressum__text">What is Google Custom Search?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">We have integrated the Google custom search plug-in on our website. Google is the largest and best-known search engine in the world and is operated by the US company Google Inc. For the European area the company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible. Through the custom Google search, data from you may be transferred to Google. In this privacy policy, we inform you why we use this plug-in, what data is processed and how you can manage or prevent this data transfer.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">The custom Google search plugin is a Google search bar directly on our website. The search takes place like on <a class="impressum__text" href="https://www.google.com?tid=322365556" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener noreferrer">www.google.com</a>, only the search results are focused on our content and products or on a limited search circle.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use Google custom search on our website?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">A website with a lot of interesting content often gets so big that you may lose track of it. Over time, we have also accumulated a lot of valuable material and as part of our service, we want you to find our content as quickly and easily as possible. Custom Google search makes finding interesting content a breeze. The built-in Google plug-in improves the overall quality of our website and makes searching easier for you.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is stored by Google custom search?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Through the custom Google search, data from you will only be transferred to Google if you actively use the Google search built into our website. This means that only when you enter a search term in the search bar and then confirm this term (e.g. click "Enter"), in addition to the search term, your IP address is also sent to Google, stored and processed there. Based on the cookies set (such as 1P_JAR), it can be assumed that Google also receives data on website usage. If, during your visit to our website, you search for content using the built-in Google search function and are logged in with your Google account at the same time, Google can also assign the collected data to your Google account. As website operators, we have no influence on what Google does with the collected data or how Google processes the data.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">The following cookies are set in your browser when you use Google Custom Search and are not logged in with a Google Account:</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Name:</strong> 1P_JAR<br />
<strong class="impressum__text">Value:</strong> 2020-01-27-13322365556-5<br />
<strong class="impressum__text">Purpose:</strong> This cookie collects statistics on website usage and measures conversions. A conversion occurs, for example, when a user becomes a buyer. The cookie is also used to display relevant advertisements to users.<br />.
<strong class="impressum__text">Expiration date:</strong> after one month</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Name:</strong> CONSENT<br />
<strong class="impressum__text">Value:</strong> WP.282f52322365556-9<br />
<strong class="impressum__text">Purpose:</strong> The cookie stores the status of a user's consent to use various services from Google. CONSENT is also used for security, to verify users and protect user data from unauthorized attacks.<br />.
<strong class="impressum__text">Expiration date:</strong> after 18 years</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Name:</strong> NID<br />
<strong class="impressum__text">Value:</strong> 196=pwIo3B5fHr-8<br />
<strong class="impressum__text">Purpose:</strong> NID is used by Google to customize ads to your Google search. With the help of the cookie Google "remembers" your entered search queries or your previous interaction with ads. So you always get tailored ads.<br />
<strong class="impressum__text">Expiration date:</strong> after 6 months</p>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Note:</strong> This enumeration can not claim to be complete, because Google also changes the choice of their cookies again and again.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">The Google servers are distributed all over the world. Since Google is an American company, most of the data is stored on American servers. At <a class="impressum__text" href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=de</a> you can see exactly where the Google servers are located.<br />
Your data is distributed on different physical data carriers. This means that the data can be retrieved more quickly and is better protected against possible manipulation. Google also has appropriate emergency programs for your data. For example, if there are internal technical problems at Google and servers stop working as a result, the risk of service interruption and data loss still remains low.<br />.
Depending on which data it is, Google stores it for different lengths of time. Some data you can delete yourself, others are automatically deleted or anonymized by Google. However, there is also data that Google stores longer, if this is necessary for legal or business reasons.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Under European Union data protection law, you have the right to access, update, delete or restrict your data. There is some data that you can delete at any time. If you have a Google account, you can delete data about your web activity there or specify that it should be deleted after a certain time.<br />.
In your browser, you also have the option to disable, delete or manage cookies according to your wishes and preferences. Under the section "Cookies" you will find the corresponding links to the respective instructions of the most popular browsers.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">If you have consented to the use of Google Custom Search, the legal basis for the corresponding data processing is this consent. According to<strong class="impressum__text"> Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO (consent)</strong>, this consent constitutes the legal basis for the processing of personal data as it may occur during the collection by Google Custom Search.</p>.

Nevertheless, we only use the custom Google search insofar as you have given your consent.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Google also processes data from you in the USA, among other places. We would like to point out that according to the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for the transfer of data to the USA. This may be associated with various risks for the legality and security of data processing.</p>
<p class="impressum__text">As a basis for data processing with recipients located in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, i.e. in particular in the USA) or a data transfer there, Google uses so-called standard contractual clauses (= Art. 46. para. 2 and 3 DSGVO). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are templates provided by the EU Commission and are intended to ensure that your data complies with European data protection standards even if it is transferred to third countries (such as the USA) and stored there. Through these clauses, Google undertakes to comply with the European level of data protection when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed and managed in the US. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding standard contractual clauses here, among other places: <a class="impressum__text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?locale=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?locale=de</a>

<h3 class="impressum__text">What falls under "Other"?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">The category "Other" includes those services that do not fit into one of the above categories. These are usually various plugins and embedded elements that enhance our website. As a rule, these functions are obtained from third-party providers and integrated into our website. For example, these are web search services such as Algolia Place, Giphy, Programmable Search Engine or online services for weather data such as OpenWeather.</p>.
<h3 class="impressum__text">Why do we use other third party vendors?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">With our website we want to offer you the best web offer in our industry. For a long time now, a website has not merely been a business card for companies. Rather, it is a place that should help you find what you are looking for. To always make our website more interesting and helpful for you, we use various third-party services.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">What data is processed?</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">Whenever elements are integrated into our website, your IP address is transmitted to the respective provider, stored and processed there. This is necessary because otherwise the content will not be sent to your browser and consequently will not be displayed accordingly. It may also happen that service providers also use pixel tags or web beacons. These are small graphics on websites that can record a log file and also create analyses of this file. With the information obtained, providers can improve their own marketing efforts. In addition to pixel tags, such information (such as which button you click or when you visit which page) can also be stored in cookies. In addition to analysis data about your web behavior, technical information such as your browser type or operating system can also be stored in them. Some providers may also link the data obtained with other internal services or with third-party providers. Each provider handles your data differently. Therefore, we recommend that you carefully read the privacy statements of the respective services. As a matter of principle, we endeavor to only use services that handle the topic of data protection very carefully.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Duration of data processing</h3>.
<p class="impressum__text">We will inform you about the duration of data processing below, provided we have further information on this. In general, we process personal data only as long as it is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products.</p>
<h3 class="impressum__text">Rechtsgrundlage</h3>
<p class="impressum__text">If we ask you for your consent and you also consent that we may use the service, this is considered the legal basis for the processing of your data (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO).  In addition to the consent, there is a legitimate interest on our part to analyze the behavior of website visitors and thus to improve our offer technically and economically. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO (Legitimate Interests). Nevertheless, we only use the tools insofar as you have given your consent.</p>.
<p class="impressum__text">Information about the specific tools, you will get &#8211; if available &#8211; in the following sections.</p>
<h2 id="google-app-engine-privacy-clause" class="impressum__text">Google App Engine Privacy Statement</h2>

<h2 id="explanation-of-used-terms" class="impressum__text">explanation-of-used-terms</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">We always try to write our privacy policy as clear and understandable as possible. Especially with technical and legal topics, however, this is not always easy. It often makes sense to use legal terms (such as personal data) or certain technical terms (such as cookies, IP address). However, we do not want to use these without explanation. Below you will now find an alphabetical list of important terms used that we may not have sufficiently addressed in the previous privacy policy. If these terms are taken from the GDPR and are definitions, we will also list the GDPR texts here and add our own explanations if necessary.</p>.
<h2 id="biometric-data" class="impressum__text">Biometric data</h2>.
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Definition of terms according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong>.
</p>
<p class="impressum__text">For the purposes of this Regulation, the term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="impressum__text">
<em>
<strong class="impressum__text">"biometric data"</strong>personal data obtained by means of special technical procedures concerning the physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics of a natural person which enable or confirm the unambiguous identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data;</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Explanation:</strong> It is biological characteristics that are described by biometric data and from which personal data can be obtained with the help of technical procedures. These include, for example, DNA, fingerprints, the geometry of various body parts, body size, but also handwriting or the sound of a voice.</p>.
<h2 id="third" class="impressum__text">Third</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Definition of terms according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong>.
</p>
<p class="impressum__text">For the purposes of this Regulation, the term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="impressum__text">
<em>
<strong class="impressum__text">"third party"</strong> a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body, other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons who, under the direct responsibility of the controller or the processor, are authorized to process the personal data;</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Explanation: </strong>The GDPR basically only explains here what a "third party&#8221; is not. In practice, any "third party&#8221; who also has an interest in the personal data, but is not one of the persons, authorities or entities mentioned above. For example, a parent company may act as a "third party&#8221;. In this case, the subsidiary group is the controller and the parent group is a "third party&#8221;. However, this does not mean that the parent company may automatically view, collect or store the subsidiary company&#8221;s personal data.</p>.
<h2 id="consent" class="impressum__text">consent</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Definition of terms according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong>.
</p>
<p class="impressum__text">For the purposes of this Regulation, the term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="impressum__text">
<em>
<strong class="impressum__text">"Consent"</strong> of the data subject means any freely given specific, informed and unambiguous indication of his or her wishes in the form of a statement or other unambiguous affirmative act by which the data subject signifies his or her agreement to personal data relating to him or her being processed;</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Explanation: </strong>As a rule, such consent is given on websites via a cookie consent tool. You probably know this. Whenever you first visit a website, you are usually asked via a banner whether you agree or consent to data processing. In most cases, you can also make individual settings and thus decide for yourself which data processing you allow and which you do not. If you do not consent, no personal data of yours may be processed. In principle, consent can of course also be given in writing, i.e. not via a tool.</p>
<h2 id="profiling" class="impressum__text">Profiling</h2>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Definition of terms according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong>.

<blockquote>
<p class="impressum__text">

</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="impressum__text">
<strong class="impressum__text">Explanation:</strong> Profiling involves gathering various pieces of information about a person in order to learn more about that person. In the web sector, profiling is often used for advertising purposes or even for credit checks. Web or advertising analysis programs, for example, collect data about your behavior and interests on a website. This results in a special user profile that can be used to target advertising to a specific group.</p>
