                    In what kind of world is "The First Explorers" set?

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'world_setting'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>The game is set in the time of antiquity in Europe. The antiquity and late antiquity serve as a template for the
                factions, the game world, artstyle and goods. However, historical accuracy is not a focus of the game.</p>

                <h4 @click="openPanel == 'special' ? openPanel = null : openPanel = 'special'">
                    <img src="media/images/arrow.png" alt="" x-bind:class="{ 'rotate-90': openPanel == 'special' }">
                    What is special about "The First Explorers"?
                </h4>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'special'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>You'll experience an atmospheric, settler-like game that offers the perfect mix between building and real-time strategy.
                Look forward to a bustling world with an aquarium effect, i.e. every good and every inhabitant is graphically
                represented and you can follow every production step. Only by observing the game world will you be able to see where
                your fortunes are needed.</p>

                <h4 @click="openPanel == 'fantasy' ? openPanel = null : openPanel = 'fantasy'">

                </h4>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'fantasy'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>No, fantasy elements are not planned. There will be no fantasy peoples, wizards, werewolves or anything like that.</p>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'factions'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>Yes, it's planned to add the Romans, the Carthaginians and the Gauls.</p>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'objective'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>You will land with your ship and your crew on an island and have to build a thriving settlement from scratch using the

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'victory_condition'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>Victory by military success is firmly planned. However, there will also be other victory variants, which depend on the
                map or game mode. Friends of peaceful victories should not miss out. There are plans for victory through economic
                success or through the construction of special building projects.</p>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'building'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>Buildings and roads can be placed freely without a grid. Move and rotate the building until you found the perfect spot.</p>
                <p x-show="openPanel == 'building'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>You'll find yourself trying to squeeze out every last bit of open space in your settlement!
                There will also be hilly terrain that will increase the construction time of your buildings, so the properly chosen

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'territory_expansion'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>The territory is delimited with border stones. The border can be expanded by placing military buildings like

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'food_system'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>Production buildings basically work without meals. However, production efficiency can be massively increased with meals.
                Meals are prepared in residential buildings by cooks. The cooks get the food from market stalls. The higher the
                settlement level, the higher quality meals are possible.</p>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'inhabitant_recrution'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>Currently, it is planned to recruit them via a port. The inhabitants will then come by ship from the homeland.</p>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'combat_power'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>Definitely, especially at the beginning of a game the soldiers on their home territory will have a massive combat power
                bonus over opponents. This effectively prevents rush tactics. In the course of a game you will be able to influence the
                combat power.</p>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'mod_support'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>How extensive this will be, will be decided in the further development. Mods should be able to be searched, installed
                and activated directly in the game as plugins. Self-created maps should be possible.</p>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'community_interaction'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>Absolutely. The developer is looking forward to a lively exchange on the official Discord server.
                There, development progress will be shared and discussed with the community at regular inlefttervals.
                I'm looking forward to your ideas and feedback!</p>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'stage_of_development'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>Currently, the development is in the prototype phase. The game mechanics are being tested and iterated.</p>
                <p x-show="openPanel == 'stage_of_development'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>Once the prototype phase is successfully completed, a Steam page will be created for the game and it will move to the next development phase.</p>

                <p x-show="openPanel == 'procedural_maps'" x-transition:enter.duration.1500ms.origin.left>Currently, the focus is on creating hand-crafted maps for the time being. However, since the beginning of the
                development, it has been ensured that the use of procedural elements is possible for later. So procedural maps are
                definitely in the realm of possibility.</p>
